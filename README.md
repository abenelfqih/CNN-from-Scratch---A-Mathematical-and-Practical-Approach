# CNN-from-Scratch---A-Mathematical-and-Practical-Approach
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on deep learning frameworks. It includes a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical foundations of CNNs, covering convolution, ReLU activation, pooling, flattening, fully connected layers, and backpropagation. The project also features a practical application on the MNIST dataset for digit classification, showcasing both training and testing phases.

Additionally, we have worked on a detailed mathematical example of CNNs, which is documented in a comprehensive report. The report will be shared alongside this repository to provide a deeper understanding of the theoretical concepts.
