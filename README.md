# CNN-from-Scratch---A-Mathematical-and-Practical-Approach
his project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using Python and NumPy, without deep learning libraries. It covers key operations like convolution, ReLU, pooling, flattening, and backpropagation. The implementation is applied to the MNIST dataset for digit classification, showcasing training and testing phases.
